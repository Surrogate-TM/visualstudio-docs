# Adding and removing project items

 [!INCLUDE [Visual Studio for Mac](~/includes/applies-to-version/vs-mac-only.md)]

You can add new project items to your project by right-clicking on the Project node in the **Solution Window** and browsing to **Add > New File**:

![Add New Project Item](media/add-and-remove-project-items-image1.png)

The **New File** dialog provides file templates based on the type of application that you're creating in addition to the default templates, such as Empty Classes or Empty Enumerations. For example, if you're writing an iOS application, you can select **Storyboard** to create a new empty Storyboard file:

## Adding existing files

You can add existing files to your project by right-clicking on the Project node and selecting **Add > Add Files...**. Alternatively, to add an entire folder, select **Add > Add Existing Folder...**. The file browser is shown. It lets you search your system for the required item to add.

## Removing items

To remove an item from your current project, right-click the item and select **Delete**.

![Remove Item](media/add-and-remove-project-items-image3.png)

The delete item confirmation dialog comes up. Select the **Delete** option to remove the item from the project and from disk:
