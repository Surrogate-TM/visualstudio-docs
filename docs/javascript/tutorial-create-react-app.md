# Create a React app

 [!INCLUDE [Visual Studio](~/includes/applies-to-version/vs-windows-only.md)]

In this 5-10 minute introduction to the Visual Studio integrated development environment (IDE), you create and run a simple React frontend web application.

## Prerequisites

Make sure to install the following:

- Visual Studio 2022 or later. Go to the [Visual Studio downloads](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) page to install it for free.
- npm ([https://www.npmjs.com/](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm)), which is included with Node.js
- npx ([https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx))

## Create your app

1. In the Start window (choose **File** > **Start Window** to open), select **Create a new project**.

1. Search for React in the search bar at the top and then select **Standalone JavaScript React Template** or **Standalone TypeScript React Template**, based on your preference.

1. Give your project and solution a name. 

   If you previously selected Standalone JavaScript React Template, when you get to the Additional information window be sure NOT to check the **Add integration for Empty ASP.NET Web API Project** option. This option adds files to your React template so that it can be hooked up with the ASP.NET Core project, if an ASP.NET Core project is added.

   Please note that creation of the React project takes a moment because the create-react-app command that runs at this time also runs the npm install command

## View the project properties

The default project settings allow you to build and debug the project. But, if you need to change settings, right-click the project in Solution Explorer, select **Properties**, and then go the **Build** or **Debugging** section.

>[!NOTE]
> *launch.json* stores the startup settings associated with the **Start** button in the Debug toolbar. Currently, *launch.json* must be located under the *.vscode* folder.

## Build Your Project

Choose **Build** > **Build Solution**  to build the project.

## Start Your Project

Press **F5** or select the **Start** button at the top of the window, and you'll see a command prompt:

- npm running the react-scripts start command

>[!NOTE]
> Check console output for messages, such as a message instructing you to update your version of Node.js.

Next, you should see the base React app appear!
