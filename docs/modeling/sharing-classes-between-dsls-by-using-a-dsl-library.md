# Share classes between DSLs

[!INCLUDE [Visual Studio](~/includes/applies-to-version/vs-windows-only.md)]
In the Visual Studio Visualization and Modeling SDK, you can create an incomplete DSL Definition that you can import into another DSL. This approach lets you factor common parts of similar models.

[!INCLUDE[modeling_sdk_info](includes/modeling_sdk_info.md)]

## Create a DSL project

1. Create a new DSL project, and choose the DSL Library solution template.

   A single DSL project is created with an empty model.

2. You can add domain classes, relationships, shapes and so on. The elements in the library don't have to form a single embedding tree. To define a relationship that importers can use, create two domain classes and create the relationship between them.

   Consider setting the **Inheritance Modifier** of the domain classes to `Abstract`.

3. You can add elements that you define in DSL Explorer, such as Connection Builders.

4. You can add customizations that require more code, such as validation constraints.

5. Select **Transform All Templates**.

6. Build the project.

7. When you distribute the DSL for other people to use, you must provide both the compiled assembly (DLL) and the file *DslDefinition.dsl*. You can find the compiled assembly in a folder under _Dsl\bin\*_.

## Import a DSL Library

1. In another DSL Definition, in **DSL Explorer**, right-click the root class of the DSL, and then select **Add New DslLibrary Import**.

2. In the **Properties** window, set the **File Path** of the library. You can use either a relative or an absolute path.

   The imported library appears in DSL Explorer, in read-only mode.

3. You can use the imported classes as base classes. Create a domain class in the importing DSL, and in the Properties window, set **Base Class** to an imported class.

4. Select **Transform All Templates**.

5. Add to the DSL project a reference to the assembly (DLL) that was built by the DSL Library project.

6. Build the solution.
