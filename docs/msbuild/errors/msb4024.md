# MSB4024

This error occurs when MSBuild tries to load a project file, but couldn't load an imported file.  The imported file must be an XML MSBuild file, such as a `.props` file, or `.targets` file, or a file with any other extension that contains XML that is intended to be interpreted by MSBuild.

The message resembles the following, but this text is followed by additional information:

```output
MSB4024: The imported project file 'filename' could not be loaded.
```

Verify that the correct file is being imported, and look to the additional information to determine the cause of the problem.

See [Import element (MSBuild)](../import-element-msbuild.md).
