# MSB3245

This diagnostic code is emitted when MSBuild can't resolve an assembly reference in your project.

The full message resembles the following text:

```output
MSB3245: Could not resolve this reference. 'assembly' If this reference is required by your code, you may get compilation errors.
```

This error might occur if the item is a directory, not a file, or it could occur if the assembly resolver for that reference returns an error. It could be any error that prevents resolution of the reference, such as a missing assembly, misspelled name, version mismatch, mismatched processor architecture, or failed `ProjectReference`.
