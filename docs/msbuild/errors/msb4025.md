# MSB4025

This error occurs when MSBuild tries to load and parse a solution file and create a project, but the project file could not be loaded.  The file must be an XML MSBuild file, such as a `.props` file, or `.targets` file, or a file with any other extension that contains XML that is intended to be interpreted by MSBuild.

The message resembles the following, but this text might be followed by additional information:

```output
MSB4024: The imported project file 'filename' could not be loaded.
```

Look to the additional information provided to determine the cause of the problem.  Typical causes include the project file is missing, has an incorrect path, or is misspelled; unauthorized access; XML parsing errors in the project file; or it's open and locked by another program.
