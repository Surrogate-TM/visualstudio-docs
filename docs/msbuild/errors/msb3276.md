# MSB3276

This error occurs when MSBuild finds different conflicting versions of the same dependent assembly.

The full message resembles the following text:

```output
MSB3276: Found conflicts between different versions of the same dependent assembly. Please set the "AutoGenerateBindingRedirects" property to true in the project file. For more information, see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=294190.
```

The message suggests an appropriate way to resolve the error, if the version mismatch is intentional. The link takes you to [How to: Enable and disable automatic binding redirection](/dotnet/framework/configure-apps/how-to-enable-and-disable-automatic-binding-redirection).
