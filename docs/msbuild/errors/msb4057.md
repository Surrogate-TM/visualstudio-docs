# MSB4057

This error occurs when a target cannot be found, but it is referenced in a project file (such as in `CallTarget`, `BeforeTargets`, `AfterTargets`, or `DependsOnTarget`).

```output
MSB4057: The target 'target name' does not exist in the project.
```

Check the spelling of the target and ensure that it's present in the project file or its imports.

Check the logic of conditions to make sure that the target is included under the relevant conditions.

If the target is an individual project build within a solution that is nested in a Visual Studio Solution folder and you're referencing it with the command-line option `-targets` or `-t`, make sure that the file containing the target is properly referenced by the solution folder name, not the name of the folder on disk.
