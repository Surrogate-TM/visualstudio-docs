# MSB4067

This error occurs when a project file or an imported file contains an invalid element.

The message text resembles the following text:

```output
The element 'element' beneath element 'parent element' is unrecognized.
```

Check the syntax of that element and refer to the MSBuild documentation for the parent element to determine if it's a valid child element. See [MSBuild project file schema reference](../msbuild-project-file-schema-reference.md).
