# MSB3541

This error occurs when an invalid value for the `Path` or `Files` arguments were found during the execution of the  `FindUnderPath` task. See [FindUnderPath task](../findunderpath-task.md).

The message resembles the following, but this text is followed by the exception text from the underlying code:

```output
