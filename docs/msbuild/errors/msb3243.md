# MSB3243

This diagnostic code is emitted when MSBuild finds two conflicting assemblies for a given reference, with no way to resolve the conflict. In such cases, MSBuild chooses one of the assemblies arbitrarily and continues processing the build.

The message text resembles the following text:

```output
MSB3243: No way to resolve conflict between 'first assembly' and 'second assembly'. Choosing 'first assembly' arbitrarily.
```

A diagnostic build log will have more information about how the two conflicting assemblies were found which may help restructure your build to avoid the warning.
