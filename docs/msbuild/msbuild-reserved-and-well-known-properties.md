# MSBuild reserved and well-known properties

MSBuild provides a set of predefined properties that store information about the project file and the MSBuild binaries. These properties are evaluated in the same manner as other MSBuild properties. For example, to use the `MSBuildProjectFile` property, you type `$(MSBuildProjectFile)`.

 MSBuild uses the values in the following table to predefine reserved and well-known properties. Reserved properties cannot be overridden, and most well-known properties shouldn't be overridden except in advanced scenarios.

## Reserved and well-known properties

The table in this section shows the MSBuild predefined properties. The example column in the table relates to the following example project file, assumed to be located at `C:\Source\Repos\ConsoleApp1\ConsoleApp1`, and shows an example of the values these properties have when accessed in the project file, when MSBuild is invoked with no special command-line options.

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

| Property | Reserved or well-known | Description | Example |
|----------------------------------|------------------------| - | - |
| `FrameworkSDKRoot` | Well-known | Path to the root folder for .NET Framework tools. | `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v10.0A\` |
| `InnerBuildProperty` | Well-known | Specifies the property name that defines the multitargeting build dimension (applicable only if the current build is a [graph build][graph-build]). | TargetFramework |
| `InnerBuildPropertyValues` | Well-known | Specifies the property name that holds the possible values for the `InnerBuildProperty` (applicable only if the current build is a [graph build][graph-build]).| TargetFrameworks |
| `IsGraphBuild` | Well-known | `True` if this is a [graph build][graph-build]; that is, the `-graphBuild` option is in effect. This option means that MSBuild constructs and builds a project graph. Constructing a graph involves identifying project references to form dependencies. Building that graph involves attempting to build project references prior to the projects that reference them, differing from traditional MSBuild scheduling.| |
| `MSBuildAssemblyVersion` | Reserved | The version of MSBuild assemblies used to build the project. | 16.0 |
| `MSBuildBinPath` | Reserved | The absolute path of the folder where the MSBuild binaries that are currently being used are located (for example, *C:\Windows\Microsoft.Net\Framework\\\<versionNumber>*). This property is useful if you have to refer to files in the MSBuild directory.<br /><br /> Do not include the final backslash on this property. | `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\MSBuild\Current\Bin` |
| `MSBuildExtensionsPath` | Well-known | Introduced in the .NET Framework 4: there is no difference between the default values of `MSBuildExtensionsPath` and `MSBuildExtensionsPath32`. You can set the environment variable `MSBUILDLEGACYEXTENSIONSPATH` to a non-null value to enable the behavior of the default value of `MSBuildExtensionsPath` in earlier versions.<br /><br /> In the .NET Framework 3.5 and earlier, the default value of `MSBuildExtensionsPath` points to the path of the MSBuild subfolder under the *\Program Files\\* or *\Program Files (x86)* folder, depending on the bitness of the current process. For example, for a 32-bit process on a 64-bit machine, this property points to the *\Program Files (x86)* folder. For a 64-bit process on a 64-bit machine, this property points to the *\Program Files* folder.<br /><br /> Do not include the final backslash on this property.<br /><br /> This location is a useful place to put custom target files. For example, your target files could be installed at *\Program Files\MSBuild\MyFiles\Northwind.targets* and then imported in project files by using this XML code:<br /><br /> `<Import Project="$(MSBuildExtensionsPath)\MyFiles\Northwind.targets"/>` | `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\MSBuild`|
| `MSBuildExtensionsPath32` | Well-known | The path of the MSBuild subfolder under the *\Program Files* or *\Program Files (x86)* folder. The path always points to the 32-bit *\Program Files (x86)* folder on a 32-bit machine and *\Program Files* on a 64-bit machine.". See also `MSBuildExtensionsPath` and `MSBuildExtensionsPath64`.<br /><br /> Do not include the final backslash on this property. | `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\MSBuild`|
| `MSBuildExtensionsPath64` | Well-known | The path of the MSBuild subfolder under the *\Program Files* folder. For a 64-bit machine, this path always points to the *\Program Files* folder. For a 32-bit machine, this path is blank. See also `MSBuildExtensionsPath` and `MSBuildExtensionsPath32`.<br /><br /> Do not include the final backslash on this property. | `C:\Program Files\MSBuild`|
| `MSBuildFileVersion` | Reserved | The 4 part version of MSBuild assemblies used to build the project. | 16.11.0.30701 |
| `MSBuildFrameworkToolsPath` | Well-known | The path to the .NET Framework tools that the currently executing MSBuild was built with, with a trailing slash. |`C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\` |
| `MSBuildFrameworkToolsPath32` | Well-known | The path to the 32-bit version of the .NET Framework tools for the same framework version that the currently executing MSBuild was built with, with a trailing slash. |`C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\` |
| `MSBuildFrameworkToolsPath64` | Well-known | The path to the 64-bit version of the .NET Framework tools for the same framework version that the currently executing MSBuild was built with, with a trailing slash. |`C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\` |
| `MSBuildInteractive` | Reserved | `true` if MSBuild is running interactively, allowing user input. This setting is controlled by the `-interactive` command-line option. | `false` |
| `MSBuildLastTaskResult` | Reserved | `true` if the previous task completed without any errors (even if there were warnings), or `false` if the previous task had errors. Typically, when an error occurs in a task, the error is the last thing that happens in that project. Therefore, the value of this property is never `false`, except in these scenarios:<br /><br /> - When the `ContinueOnError` attribute of the [Task element (MSBuild)](../msbuild/task-element-msbuild.md) is set to `WarnAndContinue` (or `true`) or `ErrorAndContinue`.<br /><br /> - When the `Target` has an [OnError element (MSBuild)](../msbuild/onerror-element-msbuild.md) as a child element. | `true` |
| `MSBuildNodeCount` | Reserved | The maximum number of concurrent processes that are used when building. This is the value that you specified for **-maxcpucount** on the command line. If you specified **-maxcpucount** without specifying a value, then `MSBuildNodeCount` specifies the number of processors in the computer. For more information, see [Command-line reference](../msbuild/msbuild-command-line-reference.md) and [Build multiple projects in parallel](../msbuild/building-multiple-projects-in-parallel-with-msbuild.md). | 1 |
| `MSBuildProgramFiles32` | Reserved | The location of the 32-bit program folder; for example, *C:\Program Files (x86)*.<br /><br /> Do not include the final backslash on this property. | `C:\Program Files (x86)`|
| `MSBuildProjectDefaultTargets` | Reserved | The complete list of targets that are specified in the `DefaultTargets` attribute of the `Project` element. For example, the following `Project` element would have an `MSBuildDefaultTargets` property value of `A;B;C`:<br /><br /> `<Project DefaultTargets="A;B;C" >` | `Build`|
| `MSBuildProjectDirectory` | Reserved | The absolute path of the directory where the project file is located, for example *C:\MyCompany\MyProduct*.<br /><br /> Do not include the final backslash on this property. | `C:\Source\Repos\ConsoleApp1\ConsoleApp1` |
| `MSBuildProjectDirectoryNoRoot` | Reserved | The value of the `MSBuildProjectDirectory` property, excluding the root drive.<br /><br /> Do not include the final backslash on this property. | `Source\Repos\ConsoleApp1\ConsoleApp1`|
| `MSBuildProjectExtension` | Reserved | The file name extension of the project file, including the period; for example, *.proj*. | `.csproj`|

| `MSBuildStartupDirectory` | Reserved | The absolute path of the folder where MSBuild is called. By using this property, you can build everything below a specific point in a project tree without creating *\<dirs>.proj* files in every directory. Instead, you have just one project—for example, *c:\traversal.proj*, as shown here:<br /><br /> `<Project ...>     <ItemGroup>         <ProjectFiles              Include="$            (MSBuildStartupDirectory)            **\*.csproj"/>     </ItemGroup>     <Target Name="build">         <MSBuild             Projects="@(ProjectFiles)"/>     </Target> </Project>`<br /><br /> To build at any point in the tree, type:<br /><br /> `msbuild c:\traversal.proj`<br /><br /> Do not include the final backslash on this property. | `c:\Source\Repos\ConsoleApp1` |
