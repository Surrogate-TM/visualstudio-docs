# Excessive induced GCs

This article describes performance insights for excessive induced garbage collections (GCs).

## Cause

It's rarely justified inducing GCs because the garbage collector manages its own schedule. The only rare cases are mostly from the framework, but even that should be very rare. If you're seeing too many induced GCs, it's something to investigate, especially if you're worried about your GC time or if you're surprised by the fact there are induced GCs.

## Rule description

The [.NET Garbage Collector (GC)](/dotnet/standard/garbage-collection/) can determine the best time to perform a collection in most cases.

When an application frequently forces GC collections, it might impact performance and responsiveness of an application.

## How to investigate a warning

Look for <xref:System.GC.Collect%2A> and check whether the method calls are really needed.
