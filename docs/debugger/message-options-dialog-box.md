# Message Options dialog box

[!INCLUDE [Visual Studio](~/includes/applies-to-version/vs-windows-only.md)]

Use this dialog box to select which messages are listed in [Messages View](messages-view.md). To display this dialog box, choose **Log Messages** from the **Spy** menu.

## Windows tab, Message Options

Use the **Windows** tab to set the scope of the messages listed in [Messages View](messages-view.md). The following settings are available:

- **Finder Tool**: The drag and drop tool used to select a window.
- **Hide Spy++**: Removes the main Spy++ window and leaves the **MessageOptions** dialog box visible on top of your other applications.
- **Parent Window**: Display messages for the selected window and its immediate parent window.
- **Child Window**: Display messages for the selected window and all its child windows, including nested child windows.
- **Windows of Same Thread**: Display messages for the selected window and all other windows owned by the same thread.
- **Windows of Same Process**: Display messages for the selected window and all other windows owned by the same process.
- **All Windows in System**: Display messages for all windows.
- **Save Settings as Default**: Save the preceding settings for new message stream windows. These settings are also saved when exiting Spy++.

## Messages tab, Message Options

Use the **Messages** tab to select which message types to list in [Messages View](messages-view.md), and to specify message search criteria. Typically, you first select **Message Groups**, and then fine-tune the selection by selecting individual **Messages to View**. The **All** button selects all message types, and the **None** button clears all types.

The following settings are available on the **Messages** tab:

- **Messages to View**: Select specific messages for viewing. When you create a new Messages window, it can display all messages. When you filter messages from the **Messages** tab, that filter only applies to new messages, not messages that have already been displayed in the Windows view.
- **Message Groups**: Select message groups for viewing. The available groups include:
    - WM_USER: with a code greater than or equal to WM_USER
    - Registered: registered with the **RegisterWindowMessage** call
    - Unknown: unknown messages in the range 0 to (WM_USER - 1)

  Note that these **Message Groups** do not map to specific entries under **Messages To View**. When you select a group, the selection is applied directly to the message stream.

  A grayed check box within **Message Groups** indicates that the **Messages To View** list box has been modified for messages in that group; not all of the message types in that group are selected.
- **Save Settings as Default**: Save the current settings for later use as message search options. These settings are also saved when exiting Spy++.

## Output tab, Message Options

Use the **Output** tab to specify what data from each message to list in [Messages View](messages-view.md). The following settings are available:

- **Line Numbers**: Display line numbers.
- **Message Nesting Level**: Prefix nested messages with one period per level.
- **Raw Message Parameters**: Display the hexadecimal **wParam** and **lParam** values.
- **Decoded Message Parameters**: Display the results of message-specific decoding of the **wParam** and **lParam** values.
- **Raw Return Values**: Display the hexadecimal **lResult** return value.
- **Decoded Return Values**: Display the results of message-specific decoding of the **lResult** return value.
- **Message Origin Time**: The elapsed time since the Windows system was started (for posted messages only).
- **Message Mouse Position**: The screen coordinates of the mouse when the message was posted (for posted messages only).
- **Lines maximum**: Limit the number of lines that are retained in the currently selected Messages view.
- **Also Log Messages to File**: Specify an output file for the message log. This output file is written simultaneously with the message log window.
- **Save Settings as Default**: Save the preceding settings for new message stream windows. These settings are saved when you quit Spy++.
