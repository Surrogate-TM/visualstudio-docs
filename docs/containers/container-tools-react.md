# Quickstart: Use Docker with a React Single-page App in Visual Studio

 [!INCLUDE [Visual Studio](~/includes/applies-to-version/vs-windows-only.md)]

With Visual Studio, you can easily build, debug, and run containerized ASP.NET Core apps, including those with client-side JavaScript such as React.js single-page app, and publish them to Azure Container Registry, Docker Hub, Azure App Service, or your own container registry. In this article, we'll publish to Azure Container Registry.

## Prerequisites

The next step is different depending on whether you're using Linux containers or Windows containers.

## Modify the Dockerfile (Linux containers)

A *Dockerfile*, the recipe for creating a final Docker image, is created in the project. Refer to [Dockerfile reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) for an understanding of the commands within it.

Open the *Dockerfile* in the project, and add the following lines to install curl, Node.js 14.x, and certain required Node libraries in the container. Be sure to add these lines both in the first section, to add the installation of the Node package manager *npm.exe* to the base image, as well as in the `build` section.

```Dockerfile
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y curl
RUN apt-get install -y libpng-dev libjpeg-dev curl libxi6 build-essential libgl1-mesa-glx
RUN curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | bash -
RUN apt-get install -y nodejs
```

The *Dockerfile* should now look something like this:

:::moniker range="<=vs-2019"

```Dockerfile
#See https://aka.ms/containerfastmode to understand how Visual Studio uses this Dockerfile to build your images for faster debugging.

The preceding *Dockerfile* is based on the [mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/aspnet](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-aspnet/) image, and includes instructions for modifying the base image by building your project and adding it to the container.

When the new project dialog's **Configure for HTTPS** check box is checked, the *Dockerfile* exposes two ports. One port is used for HTTP traffic; the other port is used for HTTPS. If the check box isn't checked, a single port (80) is exposed for HTTP traffic.

## Modify the Dockerfile (Windows containers)

Open the project file by double-clicking on the project node, and update the project file (*.csproj) by adding the following property as a child of the `<PropertyGroup>` element:

   ```xml
    <DockerfileFastModeStage>base</DockerfileFastModeStage>
   ```

Update the Dockerfile by adding the following lines. This will copy node and npm to the container.

   1. Add ``# escape=` `` to the first line of the Dockerfile
   1. Add the following lines before `FROM … base`

      ```Dockerfile
      FROM mcr.microsoft.com/powershell AS downloadnodejs
      ENV NODE_VERSION=14.16.0
      SHELL ["pwsh", "-Command", "$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop';$ProgressPreference='silentlyContinue';"]
      RUN Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile nodejs.zip -UseBasicParsing "https://nodejs.org/dist/v$($env:NODE_VERSION)/node-v$($env:NODE_VERSION)-win-x64.zip"; `
          Expand-Archive nodejs.zip -DestinationPath C:\; `
          Rename-Item "C:\node-v$($env:NODE_VERSION)-win-x64" c:\nodejs
      ```

   1. Add the following line before and after `FROM … build`

      ```Dockerfile
      COPY --from=downloadnodejs C:\nodejs\ C:\Windows\system32\
      ```

   1. The complete Dockerfile should now look something like this:

      :::moniker range="<=vs-2019"

      ```Dockerfile
      # escape=`
      #Depending on the operating system of the host machines(s) that will build or run the containers, the image specified in the FROM statement may need to be changed.

   1. Update the .dockerignore file by removing the `**/bin`.

## Debug

:::moniker range=">=vs-2022"
The project uses the SPA Proxy during debugging. See [Improved single-page app (SPA) templates](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/asp-net-core-updates-in-net-6-preview-4/#improved-single-page-app-spa-templates). When debugging, the JavaScript client runs on the host machine, but the ASP.NET Core server code runs in the container. When published, the proxy is not run, and the client code runs on the same server as the ASP.NET Core code.  You already have a Debug profile **Docker* that you can use to debug the server code. To debug the JavaScript client code, you can create an additional debug profile. You'll also need to start the proxy manually from a command prompt when debugging JavaScript. You can leave it running through multiple debug sessions.

1. Build the project, if not already built.

1. Open a Visual Studio dev command prompt, go to the ClientApp folder in your project, and then give the command, `npm run start`. You should see something like this:

   ```output
   Compiled successfully!

   You can now view project3_spa in the browser.

     Local:            https://localhost:44407
     On Your Network:  https://192.168.1.5:44407

   Note that the development build is not optimized.
   To create a production build, use npm run build.
   
   webpack compiled successfully
   ```

   Note the local URL. You'll need to provide this in a debug launch profile, which is stored in your *launchSettings.json* file.

1. Open the dropdown that contains debug profiles (next to the green triangle icon or **Start** button), and choose **{ProjectName} Debug Properties**, and choose the **Docker** profile.
1. Check the **Environment variables** section and add the following environment variables if not already present:

   ```
   ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development,ASPNETCORE_HOSTINGSTARTUPASSEMBLIES=Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaProxy
   ```

1. Set the **URL** to `https://localhost:{proxy-port}` where `{proxy-port}` is the port from the proxy server (from step 1).

   ![Screenshot of Debug Launch Profile settings for client debugging.](./media/container-tools-react/vs-2022/launch-profiles-debugging.png)

   This action changes the Docker entry in the *launchSettings.json* file and launches the correct URL for the local proxy running on the host. Find the *launchSettings.json* file in **Solution Explorer** under **Properties**.

1. You should see something like the following code:

   ```json
   "profiles": {
      "Docker": {
         "commandName": "Docker",
         "launchBrowser": true,
         "environmentVariables": {
           "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development",
           "ASPNETCORE_HOSTINGSTARTUPASSEMBLIES": "Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaProxy"
         },
         "launchUrl": "https://localhost:44407",
         "useSSL": true
      }
   }
   ```

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Do not set the launch settings option `publishAllPorts` to `true` if you are using a proxy. That option publishes all exposed ports to a random port, which won't work when you set a specific port in the SPA proxy.

1. Open the file *ClientApp/src/setupProxy.js* and change the line that sets the target to use the localhost address and port on the container. You can find the port on the **Ports** tab of the **Containers** window.

   ```JavaScript
   const target =  'https://localhost:{container-port}';
   ```

   If you're using HTTPS, be sure to choose the right port for HTTPS.

1. Launch the app with debugging (**F5**).

   ![Screenshot of running app.](media/container-tools-react/vs-2022/client-app-page.png)

   If you get a build error trying to write the output assemblies, you might have to stop a previously running container to unlock the files.

1. Verify that you can hit a breakpoint in client-side JavaScript code by setting a breakpoint in **ClientApp/src/components/Counter.js** in the **incrementCounter** function, and then try hitting the breakpoint by clicking the **Increment** button on the Counters page.

   ![Screenshot showing ebugging client-side JavaScript.](./media/container-tools-react/vs-2022/debugging-client-javascript.png)

1. Next, try hitting a breakpoint in the server-side ASP.NET Core code. Set a breakpoint in *WeatherController.cs* in the `Get` method and try appending `/weatherforecast` to the base localhost and port URL to activate that code.

   ![Screenshot showing debugging server-side ASP.NET Core code.](./media/container-tools-react/vs-2022/debugging-aspnet-core.png)

1. If the container port changes, which can happen if you make a significant change, such as updating *launchSettings.json* or updating the debug launch profile in the IDE, you'll need to update the port in *setupProxy.js* and also restart the proxy. Terminate the current proxy (**Ctrl**+**C** in the command window where it's running), and then restart it using the same command `npm run start`.

:::moniker-end

:::moniker range="vs-2019"

Select **Docker** from the debug drop-down in the toolbar, and start debugging the app. You might see a message with a prompt about trusting a certificate; choose to trust the certificate to continue.  The first time you build, Docker downloads the base images, so it might take a bit longer.

The **Container Tools** option in the **Output** window shows what actions are taking place. You should see the installation steps associated with *npm.exe*.

The browser shows the app's home page.

![Screenshot of running app.](media/container-tools-react/vs-2019/running-app.png)
:::moniker-end

## Containers window

Open the **Containers** tool window. You can find it on the menu under **View** > **Other Windows** > **Containers**, or press **Ctrl**+**Q** and start typing `containers` in the search box, then choose **Containers** window from the results. When the window comes up, dock it on the bottom under the editor pane.

The **Containers** window shows the running containers and lets you view information about them. You can view the environment variables, labels, ports, volumes, the file system, and logs. The toolbar buttons let you create a terminal (shell prompt) inside the container, attach the debugger, or prune unused containers. See [Use the Containers window](view-and-diagnose-containers.md).

![Screenshot of Containers window.](media/container-tools-react/vs-2022/container-tools-window.png)

Click on the **Files** tab, and expand the `app` folder to see your published application files.

You can also view the images and inspect information about them. Choose the **Images** tab, locate the one for your project, and then choose the **Details** tab to view a json file that contains information about an image.

![Screenshot of Containers window showing images and details.](media/container-tools-react/vs-2022/container-tools-window-images-details.png)

> [!NOTE]
> The **dev** image does not contain the app binaries and other content, as **Debug** configurations use volume mounting to provide the iterative edit and debug experience. To create a production image containing all contents, use the **Release** configuration.

## Publish Docker images
