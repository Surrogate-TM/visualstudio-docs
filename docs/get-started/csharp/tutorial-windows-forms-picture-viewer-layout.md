# Tutorial: Create a picture viewer Windows Forms app in Visual Studio

 [!INCLUDE [Visual Studio](~/includes/applies-to-version/vs-windows-only.md)]

In this series of three tutorials, you'll create a Windows Forms application that loads a picture and displays it.
The Visual Studio Integrated Design Environment (IDE) provides the tools you need to create the app.
To learn more, see [Welcome to the Visual Studio IDE](../visual-studio-ide.md).

In this first tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Create a Visual Studio project that uses Windows Forms
> - Add a layout element
> - Run your application

## Prerequisites

You need Visual Studio to complete this tutorial.
Visit the [Visual Studio downloads page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) for a free version.

## Create your Windows Forms project

When you create a picture viewer, the first step is to create a Windows Forms App project.

::: moniker range="vs-2019"
1. Open Visual Studio.

1. On the start window, select **Create a new project**.

   ![Screenshot shows the Create a new project option in the Visual Studio start window.](../media/tutorial-windows-forms-picture-viewer-layout/create-new-project-dark-theme-2019.png)

1. On the **Create a new project** window, search for *Windows Forms*. Then select **Desktop** from the **Project type** list.

1. Select the **Windows Forms App (.NET Framework)** template for either C# or Visual Basic, and then select **Next**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you don't see the **Windows Forms App (.NET Framework)** template, you can install it from the **Create a new project** window. In the **Not finding what you're looking for?** message, select the **Install more tools and features** link.

1. In the **Configure your new project** window, name your project *PictureViewer*, then select **Create**.

::: moniker-end

Visual Studio creates a solution for your app.
A solution is a container for all of the projects and files needed by your app.

At this point, Visual Studio displays an empty form in the **Windows Form Designer**.

## Add a layout element

Your picture viewing app contains a picture box, a checkbox, and four buttons, which you'll add in [the next tutorial](tutorial-windows-forms-picture-viewer-controls.md).
The layout element controls their location on the form.
This section shows you how to change the title of your form, resize the form, and add a layout element.

1. In your project, select the Windows Forms Designer.
   The tab reads **Form1.cs [Design]** for C# or **Form1.vb [Design]** for Visual Basic.

1. Select anywhere in **Form1**.

1. The **Properties** window now displays properties for the form.
   The **Properties** window is usually in the lower right of Visual Studio.
   This section controls various properties, such as foreground and background color, title text that appears at the top of the form, and the size of the form.

   If you don't see **Properties**, select **View** > **Properties Window**.

1. Find the **Text** property in the **Properties** window.
   Depending on how the list is sorted, you might need to scroll down.
   Enter the value *Picture Viewer*, and then choose **Enter**.

   Your form now has the text **Picture Viewer** in its title bar.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can display properties by category or alphabetically.
   > Use the buttons on the **Properties** window to switch back and forth.

1. Select the form, again. Select the form's lower-right drag handle.
   The handle is a small white square in the lower-right corner of the form.

   ![Screenshot shows the Forms window with the Drag handle in the lower right.](../media/tutorial-windows-forms-picture-viewer-layout/windows-form-drag-handle.png)

   Drag the handle to resize the form so the form is wider and a bit taller.
   If you look at the **Properties** window, the **Size** property has changed.
   You can also change the size of the form by changing the **Size** property.

1. On the left side of the Visual Studio IDE, select the **Toolbox** tab.
   If you don't see it, select **View** > **Toolbox** from the menu bar or **Ctrl**+**Alt**+**X**.

1. Select the small triangle symbol next to **Containers** to open the group.

   ![Screenshot shows the Containers group in the Toolbox tab.](../media/tutorial-windows-forms-picture-viewer-layout/toolbox-container-table-layout-panel.png)

1. Double-click **TableLayoutPanel** in the **Toolbox**.
   You can also drag a control from the toolbox onto the form.
   The TableLayoutPanel control appears in your form.

   ![Screenshot show the form with the TableLayoutPanel control added.](../media/tutorial-windows-forms-picture-viewer-layout/table-layout-format-added.png)

   > [!NOTE]
   > After you add your TableLayoutPanel, if a window appears inside your form with the title **TableLayoutPanel Tasks**, click anywhere inside the form to close it.

1. Select the **TableLayoutPanel**.
   You can verify what control is selected by looking at the **Properties** window.

   ![Screenshot shows the Properties window showing the TableLayoutPanel control.](../media/tutorial-windows-forms-picture-viewer-layout/table-layout-panel-properties.png)

1. With the TableLayoutPanel selected, find the **Dock** property, which has the value **None**.
   Select the dropdown arrow and then select **Fill**, which is the large button in the middle of the dropdown menu.

   ![Screenshot shows the Properties window with Fill selected.](../media/tutorial-windows-forms-picture-viewer-layout/dock-property.png)

   *Docking* refers to how a window is attached to another window or area.

   The TableLayoutPanel now fills the entire form.
   If you resize the form again, the TableLayoutPanel stays docked, and resizes itself to fit.

1. In the form, select the TableLayoutPanel.
   In the upper-right corner, there's a small black triangle button.

   Select the triangle to display the control's task list.

   ![Screenshot shows TableLayoutPanel tasks.](../media/tutorial-windows-forms-picture-viewer-layout/table-layout-panel-tasks.png)

1. Select **Edit Rows and Columns** to display the **Column and Row Styles** dialog box.

1. Select **Column1** and set its size to 15 percent. Be sure the **Percent** button is selected.

1. Select **Column2** and set it to 85 percent.

   ![Screenshot shows TableLayoutPanel column and row styles.](../media/tutorial-windows-forms-picture-viewer-layout/layout-column-row-styles.png)

1. From **Show** at the top of the **Column and Row Styles** dialog box, select **Rows**. Set **Row1** to 90 percent and **Row2** to 10 percent. Select **OK** to save your changes. 

   Your TableLayoutPanel now has a large top row, a small bottom row, a small left column, and a large right column.

   ![Screenshot shows the form with resized TableLayoutPanel.](../media/tutorial-windows-forms-picture-viewer-layout/form-layout.png)

Your layout is complete.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Before you run your application, save your app by choosing the **Save All** toolbar button.
   > Alternatively, to save your app, choose **File** > **Save All** from the menu bar, or press **Ctrl**+**Shift**+**S**.
   > It's a best practice to save early and often.

## Run your app

When you create a Windows Forms App project, you build a program that runs.
At this stage, your Picture Viewer app doesn't do much.
For now, it displays an empty window that shows **Picture Viewer** in the title bar.

To run the app, follow these steps.

1. Use one of the following methods:

   - Select the **F5** key.
   - On the menu bar, select **Debug** > **Start Debugging**.
   - On the toolbar, select the **Start** button.

   Visual Studio runs your app. A window with the title **Picture Viewer** appears.

   ![Screenshot shows the Windows Forms app running.](../media/tutorial-windows-forms-picture-viewer-layout/run-empty-windows-forms-app.png)

   Look at the Visual Studio IDE toolbar.
   More buttons appear on the toolbar when you run an application.
   These buttons let you do things like stop and start your app, and help you track down any errors.

   ![Screenshot shows the Debugging toolbar where you can stop the app.](../media/tutorial-windows-forms-picture-viewer-layout/debug-toolbar.png)

1. Use one of the following methods to stop your app:

   - On the toolbar, select the **Stop Debugging** button.
   - On the menu bar, select **Debug** > **Stop Debugging**.
   - From the keyboard, enter **Shift**+**F5**.
   - Select **X** in the upper corner of the **Picture Viewer** window.

   When you run your app from inside the Visual Studio IDE, it's called debugging.
   You run your application to find and fix bugs.
   You follow the same procedure to run and debug other programs.
   To learn more about debugging, see [First look at the debugger](../../debugger/debugger-feature-tour.md).
