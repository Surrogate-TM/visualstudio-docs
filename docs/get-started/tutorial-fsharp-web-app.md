# Tutorial: Create an ASP.NET Core web service in F#

 [!INCLUDE [Visual Studio](~/includes/applies-to-version/vs-windows-only.md)]

The Visual Studio Integrated Development Environment (IDE) supports F# for several product types.
You can easily create a full web services app.

For more information about coding in F#, see [What is F#](/dotnet/fsharp/what-is-fsharp).
To create a Hello World console app, see [Get started with F# in Visual Studio](/dotnet/fsharp/get-started/get-started-visual-studio).

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> - Build and run your program.

Be sure you have the necessary components installed:

1. Select the **Start** Windows icon and type *Visual Studio Installer*.
1. Select **Modify** to see your installed workloads.
1. Make sure that **ASP.NET and web development** is selected, or add it.

1. If you made any changes, select **Modify** to install the components.

## Create an ASP.NET Core web service

In this section, you'll create an ASP.NET Core Web API project.
The project type comes with template files that constitute a functional web service, before you've even added anything.

1. Start Visual Studio.

1. In the start window, select **Create a new project**.

1. On the **Create a new project** page, type **F# web** into the search box. Select the **ASP.NET Core Web API** project template, and then select **Next**.

1. In the **Configure your new project** dialog box, for **Project name**, enter *FSharpTutorial*.

1. In the **Additional information** dialog box, accept the default version for **Framework**.

   When you select **Create**, Visual Studio creates the new F# project. You can see the project components in the Solution Explorer window.
   Visual Studio presents an **Overview** page.

1. In the **Solution Explorer** toolbar, expand the **Controllers** folder, then choose the **WeatherForecastController.fs** controller to open the code file in the editor.

   ![Screenshot showing the Solution Explorer with the Weather Forecast Controller expanded in an F# Web API project.](./media/tutorial-fsharp-web-app/forecast-controller-fsharp-solution-explorer.png)

1. Next, modify the `Get()` member to be the following code:

   ```fsharp
   [<HttpGet>]
   member this.Get() =
       let values = [|"Hello"; "World"; "First F#/ASP.NET Core web API!"|]
       ActionResult<string[]>(values)
   ```

   This code contains an F# array of values that are is bound to the `values` name.
   It passes the values to the ASP.NET Core model-view-controller framework as an `ActionResult`.
   ASP.NET Core takes care of the rest for you.

1. Select the **F5** key to run your project.
   A browser window opens to display your Hello World message.

> [!NOTE]
> If you get a message that asks if you want to accept an IIS SSL Express certificate, choose **Yes** to view the code in a web browser, and then choose **Yes** if you receive a follow-up security warning message.

If you haven't already, check out the [Tour of F#](/dotnet/fsharp/tour).
This tour describes the core features of the F# language.
It provides an overview of some of the capabilities of F# and code samples that you can run.
