# Visual Studio SDK error messages

[!INCLUDE [Visual Studio](~/includes/applies-to-version/vs-windows-only.md)]

Some VS SDK analyzer errors have corresponding articles that explain why the error is generated, and, in some cases, how to fix the error. Use one of the following steps to see whether help is available for a particular error message.

- If you're using Visual Studio, choose the error number, for example, VSIXCompatibility1001, in the [Output Window](/visualstudio/ide/reference/output-window). Select the **F1** key.
- Type the error number in the **Filter by title** box in the table of contents.
  
If these steps don't lead to information about your error, go to the end of this page, and send feedback that includes the number or text of the error.
