# Customize startup

 [!INCLUDE [Visual Studio](~/includes/applies-to-version/vs-windows-only.md)]

You can customize the startup experience for Visual Studio in several different ways, such as opening your most recent solution or just an empty development environment.

## To change the startup item

1. On the menu bar, choose **Tools** > **Options**.

2. Expand **Environment**, and then choose **Startup**.

3. In the **On startup, open** list, choose what you want to happen after Visual Studio launches. You can choose from **Start window** (which lets you open a new or existing project), **Most recent solution**, or **Empty environment**.
