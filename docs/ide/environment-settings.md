# Environment settings for Visual Studio

 [!INCLUDE [Visual Studio](~/includes/applies-to-version/vs-windows-only.md)]

In Visual Studio, you can optimize your development environment for the type of development work you do by selecting **Tools** > **Import and Export Settings Wizard**. From this wizard, you can choose a specific collection of settings that best matches your development environment. Each collection of settings optimizes elements such as keyboard shortcuts, window layouts, project and item templates, and command visibility.

The following settings collections are available:

- General
- JavaScript
- Visual Basic
- Visual C#
- Visual C++
- Web Development
- Web Development (Code Only)

## Import and export settings

You can use the wizard to export your own environment settings or import specific categories of settings. These settings can include ones that you've previously saved or received from someone else.

### Reset all settings

You can also use the wizard to reset the environment to one of the default collections of settings. Here's how.

1. From the menu bar, select **Tools** > **Import and Export Settings**.

1. In the **Import and Export Settings Wizard**, select **Reset all settings**, and then select **Next**.
