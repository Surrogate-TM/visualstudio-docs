# Replace in Files

 [!INCLUDE [Visual Studio](~/includes/applies-to-version/vs-windows-only.md)]

**Replace in Files** allows you to search the code of a specified set of files for a string or expression, and change some or all of the matches found. The matches found and actions taken are listed in the **Find Results** window selected in **Result options**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are using **Visual Studio 2019** [**version 16.6**](/visualstudio/releases/2019/release-notes-v16.6/) or earlier, the **Find and Replace** dialog box might not look like it appears here. Switch to the [Visual Studio 2017](find-in-files.md?view=vs-2017&preserve-view=true) version of this page for descriptions that'll match what you see on your screen.

You can use any of the following methods to display **Replace in Files** in the **Find and Replace** window, or use **Ctrl**+**Shift**+**H**.

## To display Replace in Files

1. Press **Ctrl**+**Q** and enter "replace" in the search box at the top of the screen.

1. Choose **Replace in files** from the list of results.

   — or —

1. On the **Edit** menu, expand **Find and Replace**.

2. Choose **Replace in Files**.

   — or —

   If the **Find and Replace** window is already open, on the toolbar, choose **Replace in Files**.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Find and Replace** tool does not search directories with the `Hidden` or `System` attribute.

The **Replace in Files** options are identical to those in the **[Find in Files](find-in-files.md)** dialog, with two exceptions: There are additional replace action buttons at the bottom of the dialog. And, there are the following replace options available in the dialog.

## Replace textbox

To replace instances of the string in the **Find** textbox with another string, enter the replacement string in the **Replace** textbox. To delete instances of the string in the **Find** textbox, leave this field blank. Open the list to display the strings you most recently searched for. Choose the adjacent **Expression Builder** button if you want to use one or more regular expressions in your replacement string. For more information, see [Use regular expressions in Visual Studio](../ide/using-regular-expressions-in-visual-studio.md).


## Keep modified files open after Replace All

When selected, this option leaves open all files in which replacements have been made, so you can undo or save the changes. Memory constraints might limit the number of files that can remain open after a replace operation.

> [!CAUTION]
> You can use **Undo** only on files that remain open for editing. If this option is not selected, files that were not already open for editing will remain closed, and no **Undo** option will be available in those files.

> [!NOTE]
> Starting with Visual Studio 2022, search performance is optimized by showing partial results, such as from pre-indexed files, before final results are available. However, when you perform replace operations, this performance benefit doesn't apply, since replace operations are only started after full search results are returned.
