# Adding Azure storage by using Visual Studio Connected Services

 [!INCLUDE [Visual Studio](~/includes/applies-to-version/vs-windows-only.md)]

With Visual Studio, you can connect any of the following to Azure Storage by using the **Connected Services** feature:

- .NET Framework console app
- ASP.NET MVC (.NET Framework)
- ASP.NET Core
- .NET Core (including console app, WPF, Windows Forms, class library)
- .NET Core Worker Role
- Azure Functions
- Universal Windows Platform App
- Xamarin
- Cordova

The connected service functionality adds all the needed references and connection code to your project, and modifies your configuration files appropriately.

> [!NOTE]
> This topic applies to Visual Studio on Windows. For Visual Studio for Mac, see [Connected services in Visual Studio for Mac](/visualstudio/mac/connected-services).
## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio with the Azure workload installed.
