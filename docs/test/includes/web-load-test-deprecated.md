> Web performance and load test functionality is deprecated. Visual Studio 2019 is the last version where web performance and load testing will be fully available. For more information, see the [Cloud-based load testing service end of life](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/cloud-based-load-testing-service-eol/) blog post. To reduce the impact on users, some minimum support is still available in Visual Studio 2022. (You can run existing web/load tests, but the templates to create new tests were removed.) Users should also note web performance and load test functionality only supports Internet Explorer, which is not available on Windows 11 and some versions of Windows 10. The web recorder feature is also deprecated because it requires Internet Explorer. Read more on [Internet Explorer Lifecycle policy](/lifecycle/faq/internet-explorer-microsoft-edge#what-is-the-lifecycle-policy-for-internet-explorer-). We recommend that you use [Azure Load Testing](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/load-testing/) as an alternative.
