# Use a lab environment for your devops

 [!INCLUDE [Visual Studio](~/includes/applies-to-version/vs-windows-only.md)]

A lab environment is a collection of virtual and physical machines that you can use to develop and test applications. A lab environment can contain multiple roles needed to test multi-tiered applications, such as workstations, web servers, and database servers. In addition, you can use a build-deploy-test workflow with your lab environment to automate the process of building, deploying, and running automated tests on your application.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Visual Studio no longer supports [Microsoft Test Manager and Lab Management](/previous-versions/azure/devops/test/mtm/reference-tcm?view=tfs-2017&viewFallbackFrom=azure-devops&preserve-view=true) for automated testing. Similarly, [SCVMM](/system-center/vmm/overview?view=sc-vmm-1801&preserve-view=true) and XAML Builds are no longer supported. We recommend [Azure DevTest Labs](/azure/devtest-labs/devtest-lab-overview) instead.
