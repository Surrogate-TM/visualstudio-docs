# Use Microsoft Dev Box with Visual Studio subscriptions

Visual Studio subscribers are now able to use their Azure dev/test individual credits for Microsoft Dev Box services. 

Microsoft Dev Box gives you self-service access to high-performance, preconfigured, and ready-to-code cloud-based workstations called Dev Boxes. You can set up Dev Boxes with the tools, source code, and pre-built binaries specific to your project, so you can immediately start work. Whether you’re a developer, tester, or QA professional, you can use Dev Boxes in your day-to-day workflows. You can even move between projects or tasks by using multiple Dev Boxes.

The Dev Box service was designed with three distinct personas in mind: DevCenter Owners, Project Admins, and Dev Box Users. DevCenter Owners create and manage DevCenters, top-level Dev Box resources that represent the units of organization within an enterprise. They work with Project Admins to create projects and define images for Dev Boxes. Dev box image definitions can use any developer IDE, SDK, or internal tool that runs on Windows. Project admins organize Dev Box Definitions into Pools for their projects and manage access for Dev Box Users. As a Dev Box User, you can select one or more Dev Boxes from the Dev Box Pools that a Project Admin gives you access to.

Dev Box bridges the gap between development teams and IT, bringing control of project resources closer to the DevCenter owners and project admins.

Visual Studio subscribers now have several ways to use Azure subscriptions to pay for Dev Box services:
+ [Azure DevTest individual credits](/azure/devtest/offer/quickstart-individual-credit).  Subscribers who receive Azure DevTest individual credits as part of their subscriptions can use those credits to pay for Dev Box services.  The amount of the monthly credit depends on the subscription level.
+ [Azure DevTest Pay-as-you-Go subscriptions](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0023p/).  You can create Azure subscriptions and attach a payment instrument to have a seamless way to pay for your Windows Virtual Desktop usage. 
+ [Azure Enterprise Agreement DevTest offer](/azure/devtest/offer/quickstart-create-enterprise-devtest-subscriptions).  With this offer, subscribers with Enterprise Agreements can pay for Dev Box with Azure at discounted pricing.
