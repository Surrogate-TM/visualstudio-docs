# Accessing the Admin Portal as an admin on a Volume License agreement

If you're the primary or notices contact on your organization’s agreement, you'll be automatically granted access to the portal upon setting up your Volume Licensing agreement. You’ll receive a system-triggered welcome email which will prompt you to sign into the portal. The email will show which email address to use to sign into the portal.  To sign in, visit https://manage.visualstudio.com.

   > ![Volume License admin notification](_img/volume-license/super-admin-notice-2020.png "Screenshot of the welcome email that is received by new admins.")

After you’re signed in, you'll be automatically set up as a super admin and can begin managing subscriptions and other admins. For information about the differences between super admins and admins, take a look at our article about [admin roles](admin-roles.md).

This applies to all Volume Licensing agreement types including, but not limited to: Enterprise agreements, Enterprise subscriptions, Select, Select Plus, Open, Open License, Government. and Academic agreements.
