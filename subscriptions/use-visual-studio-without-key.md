# How to download and use Visual Studio if you don't have access to downloads

If your Visual Studio subscription is provided to you by your work or school, or you're in a special program that provides limited subscriptions, you may not have access to software downloads and product keys in the subscriber portal.  

Even if you don't have the ability to download Visual Studio from the portal and activate it with a product key, you can still use it if it's included in your subscription.  All you need to do is download Visual Studio from the Visual Studio website and sign in.  This article will detail the steps for doing that. 

## Download Visual Studio from the Visual Studio page
The first step is to download the Visual Studio installer package from the Visual Studio page instead of from the subscriber portal.
- Connect to [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) 
- In the "Meet the Visual Studio family section, locate the version of Visual Studio you want to install.
- Select the **Download Visual Studio** drop-down and select the version included in your subscription.  
- The installer package will be downloaded to the default downloads folder on your computer. 
- Start the installer to install Visual Studio. 

## Sign into Visual Studio
After Visual Studio is installed, you'll need to launch it to sign in.
- Launch Visual Studio. 
- You'll be prompted to sign in to your account.  Use the email address to which the subscription was assigned.  (This will normally be the email address where you received a notification that a subscription has been assigned to you.)

That's all there is to it.  As long as you're signed in your computer, Visual Studio will recognize you automatically.  If you restart your computer, you'll be prompted to sign in again.
