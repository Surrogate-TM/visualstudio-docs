# The DataCamp training benefit in Visual Studio subscriptions

Eligible Visual Studio subscriptions include subscriptions to DataCamp.  With DataCamp, you can learn all the data science skills you need from the comfort of your browser. You get to choose when and what you learn. With no software to install and no special hardware requirements, learning data science is easier than ever.

## Activation steps

1. Sign in to [https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs).

2. Locate the DataCamp benefit tile in the "Professional Development" category, and select on **Activate**.

   > ![DataCamp Benefit Tile](_img/vs-datacamp/vs-datacamp-tile-2.png "Screenshot of the Data Camp tile.  The Activate button is highlighted.")

3. On the DataCamp page, you can create a new account.  You can choose to enter an email address and password, or sign in using existing accounts from Facebook, LinkedIn, or Google.  Provide your sign-in information and select **Get Started**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > When you begin creating your account, you may receive the following error message: "OOPS!  Your promo code is invalid or expired."  This happens because when your promo code is created, it expires after a few minutes.  If you receive this message, simply return to the [Benefits](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits) page and select on the **Activate** link on the DataCamp benefit tile.

4. After your account has been created, you can choose a learning path.  Options include:
    - Learning R for Data Science
    - Start Learning Python for Data Science
    - Develop your Data Science Skillset

   Just select your chosen path to get started.

5. After you've selected your path, you can further refine your learning path by selecting a goal.  For example, if you chose the "Develop your Data Science Skillset" path, you'll see the following options. Choose an option, or select **I am not sure.  Show me all career paths** to create a broader path.

   > ![DataCamp Data Science Skillset](_img/vs-datacamp/vs-datacamp-datascience.png "Screenshot of Develop your Data Science Skill set dialog. I am not sure.  Show me all career paths option is selected.")

6. Based on the path and options you've selected, you'll see a selection of Career Tracks.  Select the **Enroll** button for the track of your choice.
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![DataCamp Career Track](_img/vs-datacamp/vs-datacamp-all-tracks.png "Screenshot of Career Tracks dialog showing recommended tracks based on selected learning path.")

7. After you've enrolled in your track, the first course in that track will open.  You'll see a tutorial explaining how to interact with the course, including navigation and completing the course exercises.

You can stop at any point, and resume your training in your next session.  Just visit [https://www.datacamp.com](https://www.datacamp.com), and sign in.  You'll see your dashboard and can resume your training right where you paused. Simply select **Continue Track**.
