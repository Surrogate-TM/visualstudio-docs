# The Visual Studio IDE

As a Visual Studio subscriber, you have access to the Visual Studio integrated development environment (IDE). Your IDE version depends on the level of your subscription. The benefit appears as a tile in the **Tools** category on the **Benefits included in my subscription** page of the [Visual Studio subscriber portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs).

## Download and install the IDE

Here's how to download and install the IDE for your version of Visual Studio. We've used Visual Studio Enterprise in this example.

1. Sign in to the [Visual Studio Subscriptions](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs) portal.

1. Select the **Tools** tab, look for the Visual Studio IDE tile, and then select the **Download** button below it. You can also download the IDE from the [Downloads](https://my.visualstudio.com/downloads?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs) page.

   You’re redirected to the **Downloads** page for Visual Studio, where you can download the IDE and obtain a product key to activate it. Alternatively, you can claim a product key by selecting **Get Key**, or you can claim a key later on the [Your Product Keys](https://my.visualstudio.com/productkeys) page.

1. On the **Downloads** page, select the **Details** tab, and then do the following:

   a. Select your architecture: **x86** or **x64**.  
   b. Select your language preference.  
   c. Select **Download**.

1. Select the downloaded installer package and then, at the prompt, select **Run**.

1. On the **User Account Control** pane, select **Yes**.

1. Select **Continue** to accept the license terms.

1. When the installer starts, select the **Workloads**, **Individual components**, and **Language packs** tabs to choose your customization options.

1. Select **Install**.

   When the installation is complete, you have the option to modify the installation or start Visual Studio. 

1. To start Visual Studio, select **Launch**. If multiple versions are installed, they're listed on the **Visual Studio Installer** pane.

1. Sign in with the account that's associated with your Visual Studio subscription.

1. Choose your preferred theme, and then select **Start Visual Studio**.

   Visual Studio opens. You're ready to start using it right away!
