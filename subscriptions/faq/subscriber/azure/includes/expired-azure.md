## What happens to my Azure resources when my subscription expires?

When your Visual Studio subscription ends, you're no longer eligible to receive Azure monthly credits.  You'll begin receiving emails from Azure, reminding you to either renew, purchase a new Visual Studio subscription, convert your current Azure subscription to pay-as-you-go, or move your existing Azure resources to another subscription. The emails will provide timelines for when assets will be disabled and deleted, as well as [instructions on how to purchase a subscription or transfer your Azure resources to a new subscription](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devtest/offer/troubleshoot-expired-removed-subscription).
