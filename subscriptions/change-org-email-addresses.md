# What happens when your organizationâ€™s name or email domain changes

In today's fast moving business climate, organizations can undergo important changes.  Mergers, acquisitions, spin-offs, and rebranding can all cause the names of organizations and their tenants and domains to change.  Changes to email addresses can impact the ability of both subscribers and admins to access Visual Studio subscriptions.  For instance, if you're an admin and your email address changes, you won't be able to log into the admin portal with your new address.  Follow the steps in this article to ensure you have continued access to your subscriptions when organization name changes occur. 

## What to do if your organization's email addresses change

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You'll need to be a super admin on your agreement to make some of these changes.  If you're not, you can ask a super admin to perform them for you. It's important that you update your admin information before your email address changes.

Complete these steps to move admins and subscribers to new email addresses:

### Update your admins

1. Sign in to the admin portal.
0. Select **Manage administrators**.
0. If you have more than one agreement, choose the agreement you want to change. 
0. Add yourself using your new email address and be sure to select the **Super admin** checkbox.  Learn more about [assigning admins](/visualstudio/subscriptions/admin-roles#assigning-admins).
0. Add your other admins using their new email addresses. 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not delete your current admin email addresses until your new email addresses are active and the current ones are no longer needed.  This will ensure that your admins have uninterrupted access to the admin portal.

### Update your subscribers

Perform these steps **AFTER** the subscribers' email addresses have changed.  
1. Sign in to the admin portal.
0. Select **Manage subscribers**.
0. For subscriptions listed individually in the subscriber list, use the [bulk add](assign-license-bulk.md) feature to update all your subscribers easily.  
0. For subscriptions assigned to members of an Azure Active Directory (AD) group, there are no actions to take in the admin portal.  When their email addresses are updated in the Azure AD group, their subscriptions will be automatically updated in the admin portal.
