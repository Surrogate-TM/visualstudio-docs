# Maintain a Visual Studio subscription for Azure credit access

If your Visual Studio subscription expires or is removed, subscription benefits including the monthly Azure dev/test individual credit are no longer available. To continue using Azure with a monthly credit, you'll need to renew your subscription, purchase a new subscription, and/or transfer your Azure resources to a different Azure subscription that includes the Azure dev/test individual credit.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> You must transfer your resources to another Azure subscription before your current Azure subscription is disabled or you'll lose access to your data.  
> If you donâ€™t take one of these actions, your Azure subscription will be disabled at the time specified in your email notification. If the subscription is disabled, you can reenable it as a pay-as-you-go subscription by following [these steps](/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/switch-azure-offer).

## Maintain a subscription to use monthly credits

There are several ways to continue using a monthly credit for Azure. To save your Azure resources, you must [transfer your resources](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/move-resource-group-and-subscription) to another Azure subscription, regardless of which of the following actions you choose:

### Use a different subscription

+ **If you purchase your Visual Studio subscription directly**, purchase a new subscription or renew your subscription through Microsoft Store.
    + [Visual Studio Enterprise](https://www.microsoft.com/p/visual-studio-enterprise-subscription/dg7gmgf0dst4?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab)
    + [Visual Studio Professional](https://www.microsoft.com/p/visual-studio-professional-subscription/dg7gmgf0dst3?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab)
    + [Visual Studio Test Professional](https://www.microsoft.com/p/visual-studio-test-professional-subscription/dg7gmgf0dst6?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab)
+ **If someone in your organization purchases subscriptions for your organization**, [contact your Visual Studio subscription admin](contact-my-admin.md) and request a subscription that provides the monthly credit that you need.
+ **If you have another active Visual Studio subscription at the same subscription level**, you can use it to set up a new Azure credit subscription.

### Convert your Azure subscription to pay-as-you-go

If you no longer need a Visual Studio subscription or credit but you want to continue using your Azure resources, [remove your spending limit](/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/spending-limit#remove-the-spending-limit-in-azure-portal) to convert your Azure subscription to pay-as-you-go pricing.
